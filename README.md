## Free Pascal compiler (Ultibo Edition)

This repository contains the Ultibo edition of the Free Pascal compiler (FPC).

Based on Free Pascal 3.1.1 Trunk with changes and additions to support the Ultibo target. This repository does not include the source code for Ultibo itself, you will find the Ultibo source in the Core repository.

Note that you do not need to download the FPC source to use Ultibo core, the neccessary parts of the source along with the compiled binaries are all included in the Ultibo core installer download.

To build this version of FPC from source see the details in the Ultibo Wiki at https://ultibo.org/wiki/Main_Page
